It opens up a whole array of high-paying career opportunities, and is a useful skill in nearly any industry. As more and more businesses tap into the power of customized apps and tech, skilled coders are needed for everything from product development to software engineering to data analytics.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re new to the world of coding and wondering what it takes to turn a passing interest into a paying gig, we\u2019ll help you break it down. We've pulled together the key knowledge and skills you\u2019ll need to launch your coding career. We\u2019ll also share some pro tips on the best ways to learn code, and the wide range of careers you can pursue once you\u2019ve got some web development knowledge under your belt.\r\n\r\nTo start off, here\u2019s a quick intro to what coding really is, and what it means to be a professional coder.\r\n\r\nLearn to Code with Thinkful\r\nTake the proven path to a high-income career with professional mentorship and support, flexible ways to pay, and real-world, project-based learning.\r\n\r\nVIEW OUR CURRICULUM\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Coding?\r\nBefore you switch careers, first things first: you should know the basic definition of computer code. Professional coders (also known as Software Engineers or Web Developers) write in a variety of programming languages to create software, apps, and websites. All the apps on your phone, the browser you\u2019re working on, your social media feed\u2014it\u2019s all been brought to life with the help of code.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the way a cook follows a set of step-by-step instructions to create a signature dish, computer code is a set of instructions that guide software to perform a desired function. That should give you a good picture of what a coder does.\r\n\r\nCode can be as simple as a one-line instruction. For example, below is a one-line code in Python that prints the text \u2018Hello World\u2019:\r\n\r\nprint 'Hello, World!'\r\n\r\nThis is often the first lesson in coding tutorials. But it gets much more complex: code can go up to several hundred, even thousands, of lines. It may even call upon and embed a series of other codes. This type of complex coding is what goes on behind the apps we use day-in and day-out.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s another example: when a widget on your phone describes the temperature and the humidity in your area, there are complex network interactions taking place behind the scenes. A series of computer programs interact with satellite servers and encode a request for the data, which is decoded by the servers there that interpret the query and respond with the desired data. This is again encrypted and decrypted from lines of code to an output that you and I can understand.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re feeling inspired, let\u2019s move on to the most important steps you need to take to become a coder.\r\n\r\nStep 1: Decide How You Want to Learn\r\nCoding has become a highly sought-after skill, so you\u2019ve got many options when it comes to getting the education you need. The key is to choose the path that works best for your learning style, career goals, and budget. There\u2019s no \u201Cbest\u201D option: just the option that feels best for you.\r\n\r\nThere are three main methods for learning to code; here are the pros and cons of each.\r\n\r\nCollege Degree\r\nWith the growing need for computer professionals, software engineering degrees have become ever popular. Universities across the US offer a wide range of accredited programs that cater to the full spectrum of student aims. Most degree programs are relatively affordable, with many scholarships and funding opportunities.\r\n\r\nMost students will need to decide between an on-campus degree or an online program. If you\u2019re looking for the full \u2018campus life\u2019 experience, a regular college degree will be a likely option for you. This can also help you to build a professional network as you\u2019ll interact with your classmates, renowned academics, and visiting faculty from the industry.\r\n\r\nMost universities in the US offer associate\u2019s, bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s degrees, and certification courses in computer science and software engineering. Details about course structure, duration, admission criteria, deadlines, and scholarship opportunities can be found on the university websites. Some noteworthy programs in computer science include:\r\n\r\nStanford University: Stanford is a good option for students who are willing to get into active research in their early years of study. Undergraduates in computer science programs can even pursue lucrative opportunities such as internships and jobs in Silicon Valley. The program CURIS run by the university provides students with ample research opportunities throughout the summer.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology: The programs offered by MIT are acclaimed worldwide for their brilliant academic quality and gearing toward innovation. Students gain exposure to high-tech scientific material, like mathematical computer theory and robotics. Apart from the knowledge gained through classes, students are encouraged to get actively involved in research, which can be hugely beneficial as you work toward your chosen career.\r\n\r\nUniversity of California, Berkeley: Berkeley\u2019s Bachelor in Computer Science gives students a double benefit by preparing them for both long-term research careers, as well as technical leadership in a variety of industries. The program even has links to local industries giving students many opportunities to explore internship and research options.\r\n\r\nBut if working a full-time course would be a struggle around your hectic schedule, then an online course offered by a top-ranking university, or a bootcamp, could be a good work-around.\r\n\r\nBootcamp\r\nFor many, a more affordable, simpler and quicker way to learn code is through an online certification program or coding bootcamp. These are a great way to refine your coding skills, partner with an industry mentor, and even earn a higher salary.\r\n\r\nOur full-time web development program is specifically designed to get your coding career off the ground, fast. Our course is tailored to get you hired in the industry: our entire curriculum is developed around the skills and coding languages that top employers are looking for today. And we\u2019re constantly updating our course to make sure you\u2019re learning the most up-to-date material.\r\n\r\nUnlike with a college degree, you\u2019ll finish off the program with professional career coaching, interview prep, and guidance for preparing the perfect resume and portfolio to show off your skill set.\r\n\r\nWe even offer a job guarantee, because we know our program leads to tangible career outcomes for our students.\r\n\r\nSelf-Learning\r\nIf you\u2019re motivated and disciplined, you can teach yourself to code. There are plenty of free online coding resources and video tutorials so you can get started without taking on any debt, or committing to a formal program.\r\n\r\nMany start off on the self-learning path, but eventually realize that they need a more formal education structure to truly start a career. (Because, well, coding is hard).\r\n\r\nSo if you decide you need to enroll in a course to become a web developer, it\u2019s not because you failed at teaching yourself. It\u2019s because you\u2019re driven to start your career.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Learn 3 Coding Languages\r\nThis is the most essential step. In order to get paid to code, you should be prepared to learn at least 3-5 programming languages.\r\n\r\nThe various coding or programming languages used today have been developed to help us interpret and communicate with the binary language (those endless rows of 1s and 0s) at the foundation of all computer functions. Programming languages translate instructions into a binary language that a computer can understand.\r\n\r\nEvery coding language has different features and syntax, but they also share many common concepts.\r\n\r\nAmong the range of programming languages available, some of the popular ones are Ruby, JavaScript, Python, PHP, C\/ C++, and CSS. Each of these coding languages are used for different purposes.\r\n\r\nFor example, Ruby is used for developing websites and mobile apps, JavaScript is used for front-end development, and Python and PHP are typically employed for back-end development.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s important to have a good command over at least one programming language as you get started. It\u2019s not necessary to learn all languages in a single go, but once you become proficient in one, you can later learn other languages to further enhance your coding abilities and job opportunities.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Develop Key Hard and Soft Skills to Think Like A Coder\r\nBeing adept with some of the major coding languages will get your foot in the door. But if your goal is to excel in your role, mesh with the rest of the engineering team, and eventually get promoted, then you also need to develop some other valuable professional skills. The best jobs will have thousands of applicants, and it\u2019s not enough to rest on your coding ability alone.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s our short list of key skills you need to have if you want to make it big in the world of coding:\r\n\r\nMath and logical reasoning: A good understanding of math, along with sharp logical reasoning abilities, gives you the upper hand in coding. Even though you don\u2019t need to do hefty calculations in order to become a Software Engineer, a mathematical approach makes coding much easier. It also helps you plan the functions that a code is expected to perform using flowcharts and logic-based responses and loops.\r\nCritical Thinking: As a coder, you\u2019ll constantly be faced with problems \u2013 whether it\u2019s a minor bug that needs to be fixed, or a new app that needs to be developed on a tight timeline. It\u2019s your job to think through the challenge clearly, consider the ultimate goals of the project at hand, and discover the best solution.\r\nCommunication skills and self-confidence: Almost every sector that requires dealing with customers and peers will demand good communications skills and an assertive personality. This can also help create positive impressions on recruiters during job interviews.\r\nAttention to detail: Getting into a habit of checking and double-checking your work will reduce the chances of errors while you write code. Attention to detail and a strong working memory are skills you should emphasize to your potential employers.\r\nFocus on developing these skills in your personal and professional life, in addition to memorizing Java functions.\r\n\r\nStep 4: Design Your Ideal Coding Career\r\nCoding is among the top 25 highest-paying jobs in the US. Job listings for programmers have grown exponentially on popular job-seeking websites over the past three years, and many other top jobs now require some form of coding prowess.\r\n\r\nAnd by 2022, computer programming jobs are expected to see a 32% increase, meaning job seekers with good coding skills will be in high demand.\r\n\r\nSo you\u2019ve chosen the right path. But once you get the programming knowledge and skills you need to succeed, you\u2019ll have to narrow down your options. Read up on some of the most popular titles in the world of coding and decide which one sounds like the right fit for you. Certain roles require different programming languages or skill sets, so select a career path that maximizes your strengths.\r\n\r\nSome of the popular coding career options to choose from include:\r\n\r\nWeb Developer\r\nSoftware Engineer\r\nDatabase Administrator\r\nComputer Systems Analyst\r\nSoftware Quality Assurance Engineer\r\nNetwork System Administrator\r\nStart Your Coding Journey Today\r\nLearning to code can be a tough journey. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to hear from those who have been there and done that. Read about what you absolutely need to know about the road ahead in order to best prepare yourself.\r\n\r\nAnd when you\u2019re ready to turn your love for code into a career, we\u2019re here to help.\r\n\r\nFAQs:\r\nWhat\u2019s the difference between coding and programming?\r\nThe terms coding and programming are often used interchangeably, but programming actually refers to a broader set of tasks. Programming encompasses all the actions required to build functionality into software. Coding is strictly the act of writing out the instructions in computer code.\r\n\r\nWhich coding languages should I learn?\r\nStart with HTML and CSS. These foundational languages are used frequently, and will help you train your brain to pick up other coding languages. After that, select your next coding language based on your industry, or even the state where you live.\r\n\r\nHow much will I make as a coder?\r\nOn average, entry-level coders make around $50,000. But your salary will go up as you gain experience. There are a wide variety of factors that go into the salary of a professional coder.",
